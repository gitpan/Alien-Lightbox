2.03.3.3    Fri Apr 23 22:20 PDT 2010
    - Switch to Git

2.03.3.2    Tue Oct  2 11:45 PDT 2007
    - added POD coverage tests
    - now depends on Alien::scriptaculous, instead of using the version that
      came bundled with Lightbox2.
    - fixed dependency on Archive::Zip; its a -build- dependency, not a
      -configuration- dependency.
    - added "passthrough" Makefile.PL; we -NEED- to have Module::Build
      installed, auto-generated compatibility Makefile.PLs are insufficient

2.03.3.1    Sun Sep 30 13:20 PDT 2007
    - add POD docs to Alien::Lightbox
    - added "--quiet" command line argument to "lightbox-install"
    - changed versioning to "${Lightbox_version}.${alien_release}", so that
      releases could be issued out of sync with upstream Lightbox2.
